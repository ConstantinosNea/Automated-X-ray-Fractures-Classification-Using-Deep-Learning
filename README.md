Medical imaging, particularly X-rays, plays a pivotal role in diagnosing bone fractures. Manual interpretation of X-rays can be time-consuming and subjective. In this research, we propose an automated approach to fracture classification using deep learning techniques. The objective of our study is to develop a robust and efficient model that can accurately identify and categorize bone fractures from X-ray images.

We collected a diverse dataset of X-ray images, including fractures from different anatomical regions and various types of fractures. Our deep learning model, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), was trained on this dataset. We employed data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance model performance.

The results of our study demonstrate the model's ability to classify fractures with a high degree of accuracy. It achieved an overall accuracy of [insert accuracy], outperforming traditional manual interpretation methods. Moreover, the model exhibits promising generalization to unseen fracture types and patient populations.

This research has significant implications for healthcare, as it can assist radiologists and medical professionals in expediting the diagnosis process, reducing human error, and improving patient care. Our code and trained model are made available on GitHub, enabling further collaboration and development in the field of medical image analysis.

In conclusion, our automated X-ray fracture classification system represents a substantial advancement in the realm of medical imaging. The availability of our open-source code and pretrained model on GitHub will facilitate the broader adoption of this technology and encourage future research and innovation in the field.
